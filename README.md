This example demonstrates a common error in Swift: integer overflow.  The `calculateArea` function multiplies two integers.  If the result exceeds the maximum value that an `Int` can hold, an overflow occurs, leading to incorrect results. The solution shows how to use larger integer types like `Int64` to prevent this.
